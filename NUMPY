"""numpy library - base for libraries like pandas
NUMPY IS A MULTI DIMENSIONAL ARRAY LIBRARY 
WE CAN USE NUMPY TO STORE IN 1D,2D ARRAY , ETC
we use numpy over lists as numpy is faster
numpy uses fixed types
eg numpy can store 5 in bytes like 
default int 32 (4 bytes) 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101
we can also specify as 3,2,1 byte as per requirement
but in lists we need Object Value, Object Type, Reference Count, Size
Object type - type of object like int , str, list , etc
Object value - data/value the object holds
Reference count - number of varaibles or objects pointing to that object 
Size - how much memory the object uses
in C programming int and float can overflow
in python only float can overflow , int cannpot overflow it can grow as needed 
using arbitrary precision
Arbitrary precision means it doesnt limit size of int to 32 or 64 bit , it just
allocates more memory to store the result if needed
max size is limited by RAM for integers in python - it is slower but never overflows
max size for floats in python is 64 bit
to store more than 64 bits we can use decimal.Decimal
decimal is the module
Decimal is the class
